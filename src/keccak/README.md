## SHA-3 Keccak Implementation

The files in this folder implement a SHA-3 compatible Keccak sponge function. This implementation
is designed to be flexible, with a configurable multicycle structure that can be easily set up for
any SHA-3 digest length.

### Testing

The easiest way to test this design is to run the testbench at
[tb/tb_sha3.sv](https://github.com/infinitymdm/cu-fpga/blob/main/tb/tb_sha3.sv). Note that the
testbench checks its answers against `openssl`. You'll want to make sure you have that installed
(in addition to the usual prerequisites mentioned in
[the README](https://github.com/infinitymdm/cu-fpga/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)).

Run the testbench like so:

```bash
just verilate tb_sha3 -DDIGEST_LENGTH=512 -DSTAGES=6 -DMESSAGE_FILE=tb/sha3_test.bin
```

Feel free to use different values for the three `define`s. Valid values are:
- `DIGEST_LENGTH`: 512, 384, 256, 224 (per SHA-3 spec)
- `STAGES`: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
- `MESSAGE_FILE`: a relative path to any file from the repository root directory

If you try to run the testbench without one of those defines, you'll get an error complaining about
it. Hopefully those are pretty self-explanatory.
